The first scenario I saw, if I remember correctly, was an encircling scenario, and the word circle remained salient in my mind.

My early answers may have been a lot less detailed, while my later answers may have focused too much on the image that I painted in my head. <br /><br />Also, near the beginning of Task 2, I was trying to figure out how to perfectly match one action word to each triangle movie, so I tried not to reuse the words. However, I realized halfway through that I wouldn't be able to remember the words I already used. It might help to have more than 27 actions, and/or a prompt that let's us know that it's fine to repeat words!	M	21	true	1504	1003

Like if you are in a bad mood then you will project that annoyance onto the triangles. So what might seem playful to others you might perceive it as annoying or creepy. 	1	1	A lot of them it was difficult to tell what was going on because depending on what I previously thought impacted on what the following ones would be. A lot could be inferred about the triangles speed but like its difficult to kind of personify the objects in a way. 	F	19	true	1470	920
